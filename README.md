# RoServerMessanger900

This is just a sample description while I work on this side-project however, 
RoServerMessanger900 ( Name will be changed lol ), is going to be a public NPM & yarn package 
that will make it super easy to interact with the new Roblox Cloud APIs. I'm gonna be basing it roughly off Noblox.js
and some other open source libraries as well as updating it to use industry standard practices with 
releasing a professional package. Everything is just in testing right now, so stay tuned if you see this :)
